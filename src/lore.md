# Bean Lore

## Names
Bean names are a sequence of consonant-vowel pairs that get longer as they age. Newly hatched beans receive a one syllable name. Additional syllables are added at key milestones in their life, including upon their first time foraging for food, reaching maturity or achieving matrimony, and becoming old enough to be a tribe elder.

Bean names may be shortened in certain contexts. For example, a bean named `baguta` might be referred to as `bagu` by their mate or close friends, or as `ba` by their parents or family. If it is important to disambiguate a single or double syllable name from another, the name of one of the parents can be added as an adjunct before the name. For example, `baguta na` refers to `na`, the child of `baguta`.

## Food
While beans are omnivorous, the exact diet of a tribe varies depending on their environment. Across tribes, it is common for beans to limit themselves to food that can be eaten whole. Food is only dissected into smaller parts in exceptional circumstances, such as during famine.

This is expressed in the saying `snut tini, nu brɛd big` or `ja snut bi tini, ja nu brɛd big da` which directly translated means "Your mouth is small, you don't eat big things", or more indirectly "Don't eat what doesn't fit in your mouth".

## Settlements
### Terrestrial
Traditional bean settlements are constructed out of sticks and leaves on the floor of a forest, with one set of structures for each pair of parents and another set of structures for every few adolescents. Additional structures are often built for storing food and providing a place for the sick to recover.

### Arboreal
In forested locations with especially prevalent terrestrial predators, beans have adapted their settlements by moving them up into the trees. The lower branches of trees are used as a support structure for lighter sticks, creating a raised platform upon which a leafy roof and walls can be built. Many arboreal settlements are built in such a way that it is possible to move between any of the structures without ever having to touch the ground.

### Semisubterranean
In locations where large trees are unavailable, beans resort to digging mounds out of the ground for shelter. While difficult to construct when compared to stick structures, they are much more resilient.

## Spirituality
Beans believe that all objects and concepts have an associated spirit. These spirits have a personality and can be pleased or displeased by certain actions. If a spirit is pleased it might try to help someone, or it might try to hinder or harm them if it is displeased. For example, the spirit of fire might make the village fire easy to light or it might try to cause the village to burn down.

While all beans may attempt to commune with spirits to please them, only village elders are permitted to contact the most powerful of them. This is to prevent any powerful spirits from accidentally being upset, as the elders have the most experience out of the entire tribe.

## Medicine

## Dress
Beans will often wear crowns of flowers to enhance or contrast their natural coloring. Some types of crowns are reserved for special occassions, such as the bright white flower crown or the cyan flower crown.

## Games
### "Touch Fruit"
`bupfrut` is a game played by two or more teams where each team possesses a large fruit and attempts to stop the opposing team(s) from grabbing it. Once a team's fruit is captured the team is disbanded and the former players join another team of their choosing until all but one team has been eliminated. The only rule of play is that the fruit must be able to be retrieved once the game has ended, disallowing eating or destroying the fruit to guarentee a victory. Alternatively, some tribes allowing eating the fruit, but have a rule that grabbing whoever eats the fruit counts as grabbing the fruit.
